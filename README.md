About the project
---

When I studied JavaScript at QA Consulting, I built a calculator that allows users to do some arithmetic operations with mouse clicks.
In order to use the calculator, users need to click with a mouse on the buttons to interact with the project.
The website also includes a section next to the calculator that serves as a guide.

Challenge
---

It was quite challenging. I had worked with JavaScript before, but I have never actually tried to go this far.
When I finished this task it did not look as "good" as it is now.
So, I have done some extra research on how to represent visually when a button is pressed.

When I first created the on click calculator, it consisted of fewer buttons.
Therefore, I felt it was necessary to add a few more to make it more *"user-friendly"*.
For example, deleting a character, clearing the screen and allowing users to do advanced calculator operations.

Learned

I learned how to effectively use OnKeyDown method effectively as well using JavaScript with HTML and CSS.


Future improvements
---

Adding new buttons and adding validation. At some point, I realised this could be used as a UX project to compare the two calculators in terms of speed etc.
